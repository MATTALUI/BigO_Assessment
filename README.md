# Big O Assessment

 ### O Boy! It's time to evaluate your understanding of Big O Notation!

 ##

  PART ONE: Please answer the following questions:

 1. Describe the purpose of Big 0.

    > Big 0 is used to describe the time it takes for a function to do a task and how it grows based on the scale of the input.

---


 2. What 2 things does it measure?

    > Big is measured by the relationship between inputs and time.

---


 3. Which of the following shows Big O time complexity in order?

    a) O(1), O(n log n), O(log n), O(n), O(n^2)

    b) O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2)

    c) O(1), O(log n), O(n log n), O(n), O(n^2)

    > Number B

---



4. Which of these algorithm(s) run in O(log n) time?

   Binary Search

   Bubble Sort

   Quick Sort (average case)

   Linear Search

   > Good ol' Binary Search.

---



5. Select the best time complexity that even the most efficient sort algorithm can have.

    O(log n)

    O(n log n)

    O(n)

    O(n^2)

    > 0(log n)

---


 6. Describe what sets these these 3 complexities apart from each other: O(1), O(n) and O(n^2)

    > What really sets the three apart is the different ways that they each scale based on the number/size of the input/data that they have to work with. 0(1) it is constant, regardless of the number/size of the input. 0(n) scales exactly with the number/size of inputs. The more you put in the longer it will take at a constant ratio. 0(n^2) is the slow mama. The more you put into it, the slower it gets at a much more significant rate than a liner ratio. So speed really changes between the three.

---


7. How would you recognize O(log n) and O(n log n) time complexities in a function?

    > One example of the differences would occur if you were using a 0(log n) as a sorting function or using it to sort.
